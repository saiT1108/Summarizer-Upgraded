Welcome to the article summarizer github. This is an open-source software that runs on an AI model that I made to help users cut down substantially on reading times on most pieces of literature.

The model checks each word of the input data and compares them with a locally-generated criteria in order to create a hierarchy of the most important sentences, and sorts through them with more hierarchal processing to produce a concise, accurate summary.

###Please note: This software cannot be used with scientific articles, as it will clear out a lot of data. This is a natural language processing program, not very well suited for numerical or other data.

The program is available here: https://guarded-forest-19610.herokuapp.com/articlesummarizer/
